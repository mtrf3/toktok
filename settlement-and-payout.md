# Settlement and Payout

**Standard Settlement Time**

* **Time Frame:** Payments are typically settled within 1 to 3 business days from the transaction date. This window allows us to properly process and transfer the funds to your designated bank account.

**Delay in Settlement**

*   **Fraud Suspicion:** If a transaction is flagged for potential fraud, the settlement process may take longer than the standard time frame. This is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure the security of all transactions.

    **Procedure:**

    * **Initial Review:** Our automated systems continuously monitor transactions for suspicious activity. If a transaction is flagged, it undergoes a preliminary review.
    * **Detailed Investigation:** If the initial review raises concerns, our security team conducts a detailed investigation to assess the risk associated with the transaction.
    * **Resolution and Notification:** Once the investigation is complete, we will either proceed with the settlement or cancel the transaction if fraud is confirmed. You will be notified of the outcome and any actions required on your part.

**Importance of Accurate Information**

* Providing accurate and up-to-date business and banking information is crucial to avoid delays in the settlement process. Ensure that all your details in our system are current to facilitate a smooth transaction flow.

**Support for Settlement Issues**

* If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the settlement process, please contact our support team at support@sitesway.sa. We are here to assist you in resolving any concerns promptly.
